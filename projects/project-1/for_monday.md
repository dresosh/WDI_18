Homework for the Holiday Weekend

#1. Prep for Project 1

1. Re-read the [markdown for Project 1](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_18/tree/master/projects/project-1) and make sure you have a good understanding of the requirements. 

2. create a **markdown** (readme.md) with your **Wireframes** and **User Stories** in preparation for a presentation on Monday morning. Create a **new github repo** and push the markdown to github. If you need extra help on how to make a markdown you can follow this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_18/blob/master/projects/project-1/markdown.md) in the class repo 

3. On Monday, each student will do a quick presentation on what they plan to build.

4. Once this is done, you may, of course, start building. Use codepen.io for inspiration. Please push your code to the same github repo that contains your readme.


#2. CSS Animations (optional)

CSS animation tutorial: webdesign.tutsplus.com

Take a look at the following [tutorial](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-introduction-to-css-animation--cms-21068) on CSS animations. Have a play around with this and try to build something cool. There will be no official follow up to this task. This is optional.
