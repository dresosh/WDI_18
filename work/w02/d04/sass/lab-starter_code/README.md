# SASS-LAB

## OBJECTIVES

- Get practical experience using SASS
- Learn the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor by converting standard CSS into SASS

------

For this lab we’ll be working again with the “Relaxr” lab.

- You’ve been provided with starter code
- Focus on reducing duplicate code blocks by using mixins
- Take advantage of SASS’s nesting rules
- Find common values (e.g. colors, border radii, etc.) that are being duplicated and declare them as variables

The original CSS file has been renamed to `original-style.css` . Please create a new file named `style.scss` and run the terminal command which watches for changes on the `css` file and automatically compiles down to `style.css`.
