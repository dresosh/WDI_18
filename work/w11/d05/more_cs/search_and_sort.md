#Sort Algorithms

In groups, research the following sort algorithms:

- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort

For each algorithm, prepare and present the following:

- **The Gist** -- a paragraph or two describing what the algo is about and how it works.

- **A Gif** -- a little video or gif showing how it works

- **Real-World Analogy** -- something to help us understand how the algo works by mirroring an activity or implementation we might be familiar with.

- **Is It Good?** -- tell us about the pros and cons of this sort, its Big O performance, and when we might want to use it (or why we might not).

- **Sample** -- find (or write) a sample implementation in Ruby or JavaScript, and share it with the group.


*Make sure to write these down so you can hipchat them to the group and we can compile a shared reference!*

Activity time will follow -- you'll get to direct your classmates through the sorts you learned about in a real-life example.
