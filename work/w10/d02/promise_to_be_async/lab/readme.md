## `Promise` yourselfs lab

#### --Pair up for 30 minutes--

**Work Together -** You must come to agreement on the format of the user, and how data will be transacted. This is your first project as a small team... here are your teams:

```
Noah - Adam
Kayla - Paul
Jeff - Julie
Kyle - Andre
Alex - Percy
Steve - Greg [Dual Navigator]
```

**Person A -** Build an API endpoint with Node, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose too). This should handle incoming requests, and have 3 routes. It should be able to create and update and delete users, they can be simple... Don't go wild on the models.

**Person B -** Create some asynchronous requests that add users to the database. You should add at least 5 users, update 2 of those, and delete 1.
