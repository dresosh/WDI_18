## Weekend Lab - Todo List

You're mission, if you choose to accept it (which you do, because we said so) is to build a SPA with your partner in MEAN Stack.

###Objectives:

- **Person A** - client-side (`Angular`)
	- Use Bower
	- Leverage at least one built in filter
	- Use your factories when writing promises for `$http` transactions
	- http-server to serve flat files
	- Use UI-Router
	- Bonuses:
		- Write your own custom filter
		- Write a custom directive
		
- **Person B** - server-side (`MongoExpressNodeJS`)
	- Use NPM
	- `MEN` stack
		- Setup DB
		- Build server.js
	- 2 models
		- A user model
		- A user specific todo list model
	- Related Controllers

- **Both**
	- Write 4 tests (2 Client-side - 2 Server-Side )
	- JSON only transactions to and from the NodeJS Server
	- Authentication w/ Angular
	- Git Team Workflow (one repository)
	- Bonus:
		- Deploy to heroku & GH-Pages


**GROUPS:**
Remember you must come to agreement on the transaction models you use for sending and receiving data to the DB.
