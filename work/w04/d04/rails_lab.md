#RAILS PARTY!

## Let's make a "To Do" app
Making "To Do" apps is NOT just for babies. Some big money apps are basically just lists of things to do that you can then cross off.

Remember this is a rails PARTY. That means you need to talk to everybody at the party. We're going to pair program this out, but you should feel free to walk around and talk to other groups. 

People don't wear headphones at a party!


## Things to consider -

* We will need a MODEL - what should we call this model? 

* We will also need a CONTROLLER that will do things to this model of ours (we want to CRUD it - what actions should the controller do? We can come back to this)

* We will also need a bunch of VIEWS. The views we need are index, show, edit, and new.

* We will also need ROUTES. The routes file is the first thing a request hits on its way to the server. It takes the HTTP request and the address, and routes it to the correct controller action.
