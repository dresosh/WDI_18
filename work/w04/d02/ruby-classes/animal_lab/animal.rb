class Animal

	# 2 - Use attr_reader, attr_writer, or attr_accessor
	# to make instance variables readable, writable, or both.

	# 1 - Write an initialize method here
	# The initialize method takes arguments, 
	# then assigns these to instance variables.
	# e.g. you could give your animal a 'strength' variable, and a 'health' variable

	# 3 - Write a method that makes your animal do something simple.
	# e.g. say_hello could simply put something to the console.

	# 4 - Write a method that makes your animal do something more complicated.
	# e.g. eat_vegetables could increase the animal's health
