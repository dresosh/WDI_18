|----------------------	|------------	|---------------------
| Review 					| 5 min		| 
| Debugging				| 0 min 		| 5.2.1 - Debugging JS 
| In Browser				| 0 min		| 5.2.2 - Browser Debugging
| Helper operators		| 0 min		| 5.2.3 - typeof /instanceof
| Break Points			| 0 min		| 5.2.4 - Run code line by line

**Objectives** *SWBAT:*

- Identify and resolve "logical errors"
- Use logs to troubleshoot errors in an application (console log in Dev Tools)
- Conduct real-time debugging in the browser. **debugger;**
- How to read a Stack trace
- Access properties of a class using helper methods ( typeOf operator for datatype comparison)
- Use debuggers and breakpoints to identify logical errors in expressions

## 5.2.1 - Debugging JavaScript
Searching for errors in programming code is called code debugging.

Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in debugger.

Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.

With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.

### Syntax errors
### logical errors
### console.log
### `debugger;` -
