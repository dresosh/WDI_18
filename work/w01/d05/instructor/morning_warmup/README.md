##HOISTING warmup

https://repl.it/BBlh --- how would I fix this?

https://repl.it/BBlr --- I defined my function using a var keyword. There are two ways to the make this code run, what are they?


#DOM MANIPULATION warmup

There are three simple steps
// assuming our HTML and JS are linked correctly:

1) Grab an element!
```
var element = document.querySelector(".myButton");
```

2) Tell that element to LISTEN for an event, then DO SOMETHING when it hears it!
```
element.addEventListener('click', doSomething)
```

3) Write what that 'something' is, that you want it to do.
```
function doSomething(){
	console.log("I got clicked, yo");
}
```
