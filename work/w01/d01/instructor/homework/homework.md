While building web application, we seek to efficiently organizing/modify our files and directories.  Using your terminal to navigate and modify files will become second nature.  We need to practice!  Let’s spice up our life with a collection of files and directories for managing the Spice Girls’ lyrics.

 1. make a directory `spice_girls` to hold spice girls albums and songs
 2. in `spice_girls` make the directories `spice` `spiceworld` `forever`
 3. put the lyrics to "wannabe" and "denying" into their respective album folders
 4. in the `spice_girls` folder make the directory `greatest_hits`
  - Hint: make sure you aren't in one of the album folders already when you make `greatest_hits`
