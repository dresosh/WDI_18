# WEEKEND LAB 1

### This is a group project, you are five groups of two, and one group of three... here are your groups:

*Slack each other phone numbers or emails*

```
TOM(Alex)       -   JIM (Noah)
FRED(Kyle)      -   TIM(Jeff)
JAMES(Adam)     -   PHYLLIS (Julie)
JILL(Tali)      -   JACK(Paul)
MIKE(Steve)     -   RICHARD(Andre) 
TERENCE(Percey) -   AMELIA(kayla)   -   JOSH(Greg)
```

Quickly come to a decision on what you would like to do with your group of 2 or 3... so...

What can you make? You're welcome to be creative, but if you need some ideas:

- An app to help organize your fancy scotch collection
- An app for a library to know which books are currently lent out
- An app for a restaurant kitchen to know what orders have come in


## Objectives
- Build a MEN *(Mongo Express Node)* stack app
- Express Routes for full CRUD
- CRUD responds with JSON or inline HTML
- Use Mongoose for your models
- Have at least two Models
- Use ONE forked Git repository
- Deploy to heroku/mongolab

### Bonus Objectives
- Build your own index.html that sends and recieves data. ( *Hint: Promise to XHR2* )
- Sub-documents

## Deliverables

#### Students... deliverables will be checked Monday. We will be looking for all of the things taught this week (Except Promises, but you should totally try)

- A working MEN stack application.
- Folder structure to define your applcation achitecture (We've been doing this for a bit now, think Model + Controllers)
- Multiple Commits from all team members
- All repositories / forks must have the full completed app
- Deployed and running app on `heroku`

### Bonus Deliverables

- Client side should be deployed and running on `GH-Pages`


## Resources:
This one you will need for your node server... as it may not allow you to ping your applciation with an index page not served by it.
The app must be to be set to allow cross origin responding. For now, set: [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#The_HTTP_response_headers) to `*`
