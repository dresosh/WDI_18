# Rails API Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Using what we've learned in the Rails API lesson, build a movie database for yourself. 

Use the Postman tool - [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) - to test your work and work through your errors, if needed!  Remember, the pattern from earlier: make the routes and then the controllers to control the flow of your application and give the user the appropriate response code.

## Exercise

#### Requirements:
- Make a CRUD app, in rails, that accepts and responds to JSON.
- Movies should have a title, a year, and a summary.

#### Bonus things:
- Modify your app so that there is also an Actor model. There should be a many-to-many relationship between Actor and Movie.
- Make sure your api can CRUD actors as well as movies.
