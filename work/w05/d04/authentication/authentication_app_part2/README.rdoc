This is a basic authentication example app.

There are three extra things I have added since the lesson:

1) A root route (set to users#new)

2) Automatic login for when a user signs up for the first time

3) "include SessionsHelper" in the users controller. This allows us to use the "current_user" method (that was defined in sessions_helper.rb)
in our controller, if we really want to.
