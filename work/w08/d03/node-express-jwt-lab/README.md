# Authentication with JWTs!

## Your task

In pairs, build a namespaced API that can CRUD users. In order to Read any user, or the index of Users, the user must be logged in. 

There should also be an openly accessible homepage (e.g. at the root -  http://localhost:8080/), that describes how to use the API to CRUD users.

Does this sound familiar? It should - it is pretty much identical to what we've been doing.

## But... there's a catch
This is a pair programming exercise. The driver does the coding, but _only_ _the_ _navigator_ is allowed to look at the code we wrote this morning. Make sure you comment your code, and remember to swap over regularly!
